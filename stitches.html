			<h1>---Stitches---</h1>
			<h3>Chain Stitch</h3>
			<img src="media/chain.jpg" alt="hooks" class="pic3">
				<p>A chain stitch is the most basic crochet stitch that every beginner must know.<br>
				Most patterns, if not all, start with a number of chain stitches that are then built off of with different sitiches.<br>
				<ol>
					<li>Make a slip knot, and insert your hook.</li><br>
					<li>Yarn over and pull up a new loop.</li><br>
					<li>The first chain stitch is complete.</li><br>
					<li>Repeat to make the next chain stitch and the rest of the foundation chain.</li><br>
				</ol>
			<h3>Single Crochet</h3>
			<img src="media/single.jpg" alt="hooks" class="pic3">
				<p>Single crochet is the next easiest and most useful stitch you shuld learn.<br>
				The abbreviation for this stitch that you would see in patterns is "SC".<br>
				<ol>
					<li>You must make a chain stitch before starting to single crochet.</li><br>
					<li>Insert hook into the next stitch, yarn over your hook, and pull up a loop.</li><br>
					<li>You should have two loops on your hook now.</li><br>
					<li>Then, yarn over again and pull through both loops on the hook.</li><br>
				</ol>
			<h3>Double Crochet</h3>
			<img src="media/double.jpg" alt="hooks" class="pic3">
				<p>Double crochet is harder to get used to, but, in my opinion, it is the quickest stitch for big projects.<br>
				The abbreviation for this stitch that you would see in patterns is "DC".<br>
				<ol>
					<li>You must make a chain stitch before starting to double crochet.</li><br>
					<li> Before inserting your hook yarn over your hook first. You should have two loops.</li><br>
					<li>Insert your hook into the next stitch, yarn over your hook, and pull up a loop.</li><br>
					<li>You should have three loops on your hook now.</li><br>
					<li>Then, yarn over again and pull through only TWO loops on the hook.</li><br>
					<li>Yarn over again and pull through the remaining two loops on your hook.</li><br>
				</ol>
			<h3>Half Double Crochet</h3>
			<img src="media/hd.jpg" alt="hooks" class="pic3">
				<p>Half double crochet isthe least used stitch out of these stitches, but is still equaly as important to know.<br>
				The abbreviation for this stitch that you would see in patterns is "HDC".<br>
				<ol>
					<li>You must make a chain stitch before starting to half double crochet.</li><br>
					<li> Before inserting your hook yarn over your hook first. You should have two loops.</li><br>
					<li>Insert your hook into the next stitch, yarn over your hook, and pull up a loop.</li><br>
					<li>You should have three loops on your hook now.</li><br>
					<li>Then, yarn over again and pull through all three loops on the hook.</li><br>
				</ol>
